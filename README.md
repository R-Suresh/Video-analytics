# Video-analytics

Applications of found of retail based video analytics.
* Staff to consumer ratio and staff productivity: 
   * Differentiate the staff from customers based on uniforms
   * Derive the staff to consumer ratio
   * Reallocation of staff within the store to minimize the service time and enhance the assisted shopping experience.
   * Move staff to areas with less staff, more customers
* Avoiding overcrowding and ensuring ease of shopping:
   * Crowd management / Aisle management
   * Derive conversion rate for a particular product or for a particular store area, thus helping in aisle management.
   * Avoidance of overcrowded areas and ensures a pleasant shopping experience. 
* Studying real-time customer behavior 
   * Whether consumers compared a particular product with other brands?
   * Whether they looked at an item or spent significant time?
   * Whether they picked a product?
   * Whether they bought multiple products?
   * How customers interact with store signage, etc.
